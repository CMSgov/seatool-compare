### Meet the team




### Core Work Hours

Core Team work hours are from 10:00am to 3:00pm ET (US).

We strive to do most work asynchronously, as we are spread across timezones and have others demands on our time. Using Pull Request reviews, GitHub Discussions, Slack, and email are examples of ways we try to keep things async. However, we strive to be available online for meetings and pair programming during this 5 hour window.
